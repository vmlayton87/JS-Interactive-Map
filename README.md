Map the location on a Leaflet map: API

Allow the user to select a business type from a list and map the five nearest locations on the map using the Foursquare API.

coffee, restaurant, hotel, and market

need to create an event listener for the drop down menu selections. 

read the documentation for leaflet maps and foursquare api. look for ways to add the 5 closest locations based on the category selected in the drop down menu. 

What I still want to do: 
render the map to show all markers at the same time when they are created. 
remove the preiously created markers when a new category is selected
